# WQSPermutationTest
This R package adds a permutation test p-value calculation to weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions to balance high statistical power with a nominal false positive rate. WQS regressions are used to examine additive, linear associations between a mixture of multiple exposures and a single health outcome, and they involve a two step process: first using nonlinear optimization to determine weights for each component in the mixture and second combining those weights with quantile-transformed exposure variables to get a weighted index that is then analyzed as a predictor variable in a linear regression. Using separate training and test datasets for these two steps leads to a nominal false positive rate but low power, while using the same data for both steps leads to high power and a high false positive rate. This permutation test algorithm provides a p-value for the mixture index coefficient with both high power and a nominal false positive rate.
